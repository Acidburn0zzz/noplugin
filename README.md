NoPlugin
================
NoPlugin is a Google Chrome and Opera extension that lets you play QuickTime, RealPlayer, and Windows Media content in your browser without plugins. [Chrome no longer supports NPAPI plugins](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6213033?hl=en), which includes virtually every plugin except the Flash plugin.

NoPlugin searches webpages for embedded plugin objects, and plays the content with the browsers's built-in HTML5 player. NoPlugin will either replace the embedded code with the browser's HTML5 player, or play it with your computer's built-in video player.
