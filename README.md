NoPlugin
================
NoPlugin is a Google Chrome and Opera extension that lets you play QuickTime, RealPlayer, and Windows Media content in your browser without plugins. [Chrome no longer supports NPAPI plugins](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6213033?hl=en), which includes virtually every plugin except the Flash plugin.

NoPlugin searches webpages for embedded plugin objects, and plays the content with the browsers's built-in HTML5 player. NoPlugin will either replace the embedded code with the browser's HTML5 player, or play it with your computer's built-in video player.

NoPlugin was previously named 'QuickChrome', so if you happen to see references to QuickChrome in the code, you'll know why.

---------------------------------------------------------
__New in NoPlugin 2.2:__
* Interface tweaks to HTML5 player.
* Audio files now play in the HTML5 audio player instead of the HTML5 video player.
