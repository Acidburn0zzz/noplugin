QuickChrome
================
QuickChrome is a Google Chrome extension that lets you play QuickTime content in Chrome without plugins. Starting with Chrome 45, [Chrome no longer supports NPAPI plugins](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6213033?hl=en), including the QuickTime player plugin.

QuickChrome searches webpages for embedded QuickTime players, and plays the content with Chrome's built-in HTML5 player. QuickChrome will either replace the embedded code with Chrome's player, or a message to download the video if Chrome cannot play it.
